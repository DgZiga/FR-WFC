# WFC
Uses Wave Function Collapse to generate a random map

## How to insert
This tool requires:
- python (tested with 3.8.3)
- [grit](https://www.coranac.com/projects/grit/) 0.8.6+
- [devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitARM)

Once you have all the necessary software installed and ready to go, just navigate to the root of this project and copy/paste your ROM there. Rename the file to `BPRE0.gba`.  
Open the terminal, navigate to the root of the project, then run `python scripts/build.py 0xFFFFFFFF`, where `0xFFFFFFFF` is the free space in your ROM, and the script should insert everything, creating two new files:
- `multi.gba`: the updated ROM
- `symbols.txt`: a text file containing all the addresses known to the compiler. Conserve this file to know where everything in your ROM was inserted
